  <h1 class="display-4">Python Challenge 5</h1>
  <p class="lead">Question: Take two lists, say for example these two:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.</p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p>Hint:<br>1. Randomly generate two lists to test this
<br>2. Write this in one line of Python </p>
