  <h1 class="display-4">Python Challenge 3</h1>
  <p class="lead">Question: Take a list, say for example this one:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.</p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p>Hint:<br>1. Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
<br>2. Write this in one line of Python.
<br>3. Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.</p>
  <p>Max points: 5 and time limit :3 mins </p>
